A standalone docker SSL service for terminating SSL connections. It is mainly supposed to forward SSL terminated requests to a project's frontend using http, where requests can be further forwarded to the respective backends.

## Overview

## How to use it
1. Add the two following services to your docker-compose files: `ssl-service` & `certbot` and add the volume: `letsencrypt`
```yaml
  ssl-service:
    image: ethmediatechnologycenter/ssl-service:latest
    container_name: ssl-service
    build: ./ssl-service
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - "letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt"
    env_file:
      - .env
    restart: unless-stopped

  certbot:
    image: ethmediatechnologycenter/certbot:latest
    container_name: certbot
    build: ./certbot
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - "letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt"
    
  volumes:
    - "letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt"
```

2. Copy the following variables to your project's `.env` file and edit them with your data.
```bash
### SSL variables
SSL_ENABLED = False
BASE_URL = test-dev.mediatechnologycenter.ch
SSL_EMAIL = mtc@inf.ethz.ch
ENTRYPOINT_URL = http://frontend:80

### Optional nginx variables
# CLIENT_MAX_BODY_SIZE = "200M"
# NGINX_TIMEOUT = 300
```
3. Be sure that your `ENTRYPOINT_URL` is the same as your primary frontend or backend server:
   ```bash
   http://<docker-service-name>:<server-port>
   ```

4. Run `docker-compose up` and you should be ready to go! 

5. If you have personalized changes to the services. Copy the folder certbot and ssl-service to your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### ENV variables documentation
`BASE_URL` describes the DNS name for which a certificate should be retrieved. Make sure the DNS entry actually points to the machine the service is deployed on.  
`SSL_EMAIL` specifies the mail address that is sent to letsencrypt. This address should generally be a group or list address that is independent of a single user.  
`ENTRYPOINT_URL` defines the entrypoint url where any requests are proxied to once SSL termination has been completed. Typically this is a frontend service that performs further proxy passes for backend requests.  

The following optional variables can be set in order to configure the (nginx) SSL proxy:  
`CLIENT_MAX_BODY_SIZE` represents the maximum body size for any incoming request. It is set to a default of `100M`  
`NGINX_TIMEOUT` defines any timeouts for the SSL proxy. It is set to a default of `300` seconds 

Additional configuration, such as proxy passes, locations, etc. should generally be configured on the `ENTRYPOINT_URL` server.

Note: The SSL service can be disabled by setting `SSL_ENABLED` to `False`, in which case the `ssl-service` acts as a pure proxy.

## Start the example application locally

To start the example application run:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mediatechnologycenter/docker-compose-ssl-service.git
```
2. Install docker and docker-compose if you haven't done so.
3. Run in main directory:
   ```bash
   # Pull the latest images of the service
   docker-compose pull
   # Run the application
   docker-compose up
   ```
4.Check `localhost:80` if service is running

## Start the example application on a server

1. Install docker and docker-compose if you haven't done so.
2. Run in main directory:
   ```bash
   docker-compose pull
   ```
3. Change env variables:
   ```
   SSL_ENABLED = True
   BASE_URL = your-url-comes-here.ch
   SSL_EMAIL = your-email-comes-here.com
   ```
